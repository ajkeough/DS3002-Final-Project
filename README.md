#My Analysis:
#For my analysis, I chose to run a linear regression model on the data. First, I started by plotting factor against time.
#I noticed that the 'pi' values were all nearly identical, so I wanted to examine the relationship between 'factor' and 'time.'
#I found that there was a positive relationship between 'factor' and 'time,' because 'factor' increased as 'time increased.'
#However, this is only based on the number of minutes elapsed that hour, as the API resets at the top of the hour.
#I also noticed that once the hour changed,  'factor' would go back to 1 and 'pi' would have a value of '4.0.'
#In addition, 'pi' slowly approached the true value of 'pi' as the hour progressed. It essentially bounced between 3 and 4 each minute as it approached pi.
#Finally, I noticed that 'factor' followed Fibonacci's sequence.
